Your response goes here!

** I learned to build basic website using html5
	- used paragraph tag, heading tag, img tag
	- learned to add links that direct me to another site
	- learned about different types of tags like b, em, strong, subsscript, superscript

** I think html is not that hard to learn, but there is a lot of tags and there is times it feel overwhelmed abit

** Some times it feels confusing how to break the page in different parts, like where to use br tag, or should I use more div tag etc.
   And when I use w3c markup validation it said certain tags are outdated and use something else. But it feels nice when the page is up.

** I used google search a lot and used different resources like W3C, MDN whene ever I feel any doubt.
